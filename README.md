# RF-Noise-Source
Wideband noise source for calibrating RF equipment

Designed originally by Paul Meacham VK5AB

This circuit is designed to run from a 9V battery.  It is suggested that it be mounted inside a metal box for shielding purposes.
If the circuit is run from an external supply, it's suggested that the reverse polarity protection diode D1 be fitted.
For operation from a 9V battery, D1 may be omitted and jumped with a 0R resistor.
